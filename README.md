# Unit 3 - Data for Social Good Project 

## Introduction 

Software engineers develop programs to work with data and provide information to a user. Each user has different needs based on the information they are looking for from data. Your goal is to create a data analysis program for your user that stores and analyzes data to provide the information they need. 

## Requirements 

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, one-dimensional (1D) arrays, and algorithms to create your data analysis program: 
- **Write a class** – Write a class to represent your user or business and store and analyze their data with no-argument and parameterized constructors. 
- **Create at least two 1D arrays** – Create at least two 1D arrays to store the data that your user needs information about. 
- **Write a method** – Write a method that finds or manipulates the elements in a 1D array to provide the information your user needs. 
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write a toString() method that returns general information about the data (for example, number of values in the dataset). 
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions. 

## User Story 

Include your User Story you analyzed for your project here. Your User Story should have the following format: 

> As an [mukbanger], 
> I want to [see what foods are trending], 
> so that I can [make content and get famous]. 

## Dataset 

[Include a hyperlink to the source of your dataset used for this project. Additionally, provide a short description of each column used from the dataset, and the data type. ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U2a1_NSf_f7g-urxcMmznV8ia92zj95r9kIEO78W84k/edit?usp=sharing)
**Fast Food Restaurants** (String) - name of restaurants 
**Locations** (int) - number of locations
**2023 revenue** (int) - number of revenue 

Example: 

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sansuthi/global-co2-emissions 
- **Country** (String) - name of the country 
- **Population** (int) - number of people in the country 
- **CO2Emissions** (double) - carbon dioxide emission in kilotons 

## UML Diagram 

Put and image of your UML Diagram here. Upload the image of your UML Diagram to your repository, then use the Markdown syntax to insert your image here. Make sure your image file name is one work, otherwise it might not properly get display on this README.

## Description 

Write a description of your project here. In your description, include as many vocab words from our class to explain your User Story, the chosen dataset and how your project addressed that users goals. If your project used the Scanner class for user input, explain how the user will interact with your project.

Our user story is, “As a mukbanger, I want to see what foods are trending, so that I can make content and get famous”.This project provides users with the name, number of locations in California, and 2023 revenue for each fast restaurant. With more locations and higher 2023 revenues, the users can infer a higher popularity, which can be used to film more viral mukbangs. With various methods, variables, parameters, and data sets, the 1D arrays are allowed to be printed out in the DataRunner class.
